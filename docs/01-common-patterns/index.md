# Common Go Patterns for Performance

Optimizing Go applications requires understanding common patterns that help reduce latency, improve memory efficiency, and enhance concurrency. Below are twelve key strategies experienced Go developers use to write high-performance code.

1. [Object Pooling](./object-pooling.md)

	Allocating and deallocating objects repeatedly can put unnecessary strain on the garbage collector. A better approach is to reuse objects by implementing an object pool. This is particularly effective for large data structures or high-throughput workloads where reducing allocation overhead makes a significant impact.

2. [Memory Preallocation](./mem-prealloc.md)

	Dynamic memory growth can lead to frequent reallocations, slowing down execution. Preallocating slices and maps using `make` ensures efficient memory usage and helps prevent performance penalties in tight loops.

3. Efficient Buffering

	Frequent system calls for I/O operations can be costly. Using buffered readers, writers (`bufio.Reader`, `bufio.Writer`), and buffered channels reduces the number of calls, improving performance in scenarios involving file or network operations.

4. Goroutine Worker Pools

	Spawning goroutines freely might seem appealing, but uncontrolled concurrency can overwhelm the system. Instead, implementing a worker pool allows for controlled execution, limiting resource usage while maintaining throughput.

5. Batching Operations

	Instead of handling small, frequent operations one at a time, batching them together reduces overhead. This is particularly useful for network requests, database transactions, and disk writes, where reducing the number of round trips significantly enhances performance.

6. Struct Field Alignment

	The way struct fields are arranged in memory affects cache efficiency. By carefully ordering fields to minimize padding, you can improve memory locality, reduce cache misses, and optimize access speed.

7. Avoiding Interface Boxing

	Interfaces provide flexibility, but if used improperly, they can introduce hidden allocations. Avoid unnecessary conversions between concrete types and interfaces, as this reduces memory overhead and improves execution speed.

8. Zero-Copy Techniques

	Copying large amounts of data is expensive. You can eliminate unnecessary copying by leveraging slicing and direct byte-buffer manipulations, leading to faster data transfers, particularly in I/O-heavy applications.

9. Atomic Operations and Synchronization Primitives

	Synchronization mechanisms such as `sync.Mutex` and `sync.RWMutex` prevents race conditions, but they can also cause contention. Where possible, atomic operations (sync/atomic) provide a lock-free way to manage shared state efficiently.

10. Lazy Initialization (`sync.Once`)

	Some resources are expensive to initialize, yet they might only be needed occasionally. Using `sync.Once` ensures that such operations are performed only when necessary and executed just once, avoiding redundant computation.

11. Efficient Context Management

	Properly managing timeouts and cancellations prevents wasted computation and improves responsiveness. The `context` package allows you to propagate deadlines across goroutines, ensuring resources are released as soon as they are no longer needed.

12. Immutable Data Sharing

	When multiple goroutines need access to the same data, making it immutable prevents the need for locks, reduces contention, and allows concurrent reads without blocking.
