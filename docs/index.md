# Go Optimization Guide: Patterns and Techniques for High-Performance Applications

The **Go App Optimization Series** is a collection of technical articles aimed at helping developers write faster, more efficient Go applications. Whether you're building high-throughput APIs, microservices, or distributed systems, this series offers practical patterns, real-world use cases, and low-level performance insights to guide your optimization efforts.

While Go doesnâ€™t expose as many knobs for performance tuning as languages like C++ or Rust, it still provides **plenty of opportunities** to make your applications significantly faster. From memory reuse and allocation control to efficient networking and concurrency patterns, Go offers a pragmatic set of tools for writing high-performance code.

We focus on **concrete techniques** you can apply immediatelyâ€”covering everything from core language features to advanced networking strategies.

## ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Covered So Far

### [Common Go Patterns for Performance](./01-common-patterns/index.md)

In this first article, we explore a curated set of high-impact performance patterns every Go developer should know:

- Using `sync.Pool` effectively
- Avoiding unnecessary allocations
- Struct layout and memory alignment
- Efficient error handling
- Zero-cost abstractions with interfaces
- In-place sorting and slices reuse

Each pattern is grounded in practical use cases, with benchmarks and examples you can copy into your own codebase.

## ðŸ”œ Whatâ€™s Coming Next

### High-Performance Networking in Go *(working title)*

In our upcoming deep dive into networking, we'll focus on building high-throughput network services with Goâ€™s standard library and beyond. This includes:

- Efficient use of `net/http` and `net.Conn`
- Reusing buffers and minimizing GC pressure
- Managing large volumes of concurrent connections
- Performance tuning with epoll/kqueue and `GOMAXPROCS`
- Load testing techniques and bottleneck diagnostics

We'll also explore when to drop down to lower-level libraries like `fasthttp`, and how to balance performance with maintainability.
